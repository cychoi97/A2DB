<h1 align="center"> SBAE: Improving the Image Quality of Contrast-enhanced CT using Schr√∂dinger Bridge Autoencoder for Diagnosing Pulmonary Embolism </h1>

PyTorch implementation of **SBAE**. SBAE is a combination model of [I2SB](https://github.com/NVlabs/I2SB) and [Diffusion Autoencoder](https://github.com/phizaz/diffae) for improving low quality of contast-enhanced CT scans to high quality of those image-to-image translation.

Details will be released soon.
